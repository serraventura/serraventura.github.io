## Here's who I am & what I do ##

I've been working as a Software Developer since 2004. In my professional life I've worked with different technologies from ASP3 to Java to Node.js.
 
My focus has always been web development, meaning that for more than 10 years I had to deal with Backend and Frontend techniques. In the recent years my focus has been mainly on Javascript stack as a Full Stack Engineer.
 
Nowadays, I have enough skills to develop any product from Frontend to Backend to relational database.

Aug 2019 → Sep 2021
>  Working as Software Engineer for multiple projects at Zoopla. Hands on full development cycle from dev environment to production on different stacks.
>
>  <ins>**As a Frontend Engineer**</ins> I’ve helped the company working from data analytics migration plans to new feature implementations in React.
>
>  Working on a plan to migrate Zoopla website from GA to Segment. As part of the job I had to understand a 10 years old GTM implementation legacy and define how to migrate to a new tool, Segment.
>
>  Working on rebranding full PDP and DDP pages, implementing new features from scratch using React, Next.js, Styled Components along with Storybook and GraphQL. This was part of a big move from Perl legacy stack to a completely fresh new stack that I helped to build.
>
>  `Custom GTM templates, Segment, javascript, data modeling, React, Next.js, Styled Components, Storybook, GraphQL`
>
>
>   <ins>**As a Fullstack Engineer**</ins> I’ve helped the company to build the new stack that would replace the legacy one.
>
>   Working in a brand new project to be built from scratch, now my goal was to help the company to define how the future should look like. Identifying and finding better ways to improve our tech stack and velocity.
>
>   The process was driven mainly by POCs, where once it is proved workable that approach would be followed.
>
>   <ins>**Gitlab CI/CD**</ins>
>
>   One of the main points identified to be addressed was the struggle that every team in the company had to ship new code to QA and PROD. The CI/CD done in Jenkins and complex terraform modules plus bespoke CLI tools was time consuming and engineers didn’t understand how things worked under the hood.
>
>   A POC using Gitlab CI/CD proved to be simpler, powerfull, extendable and less time consuming. We managed to decrease the time to enable CI/CD in a project from days to hours and there are still room for improvements to allow a project to enable CI/CD in minutes.

>   <ins>**GraphQL**</ins>
>
>   Many of the APIs were written in Perl initially to be Restful APIs. In the course of time those APIs became a mix of concerns and more similar to BFFs (Backend For Frontends). Every new changes/features needed for the FE a Perl API needed to be maintained which was not the companies goal.
>
>   A new layer in GraphQL using Nodejs was our proposal. Nodejs is familiar for FE engineers what would allow more flexibility and velocity and also make more sense for BFFs.
>
>   A GraphQL API was created and designed by domain to support the multiple Micro FE apps. The goal was simple, design the best BFF as possible for the FE app through Schemas and Resolvers and don’t bother about datasource complexities.
>
>   Over time, would be simpler to connect multiple datasources from different stack to the BFFs without much complexity.
>
> `Docker, AWS ECS, Terraform, Nodejs, Typescript, Apollo Server, GraphQL Codegen`
>
>   <ins>**Scalable and integrated GraphQL service**</ins>
>
>   One of the challenges with our new GraphQL layer was to integrate with many of our services and scale it properly for production. Bringing our GraphQL from AWS ECS to AWS Lambdas would benefit us with easy integration for Authentication through API Gateway and more layers of security as for example WAF.
>
>   Serveless Framework was a great addition to improve our development experience with lambdas. Helping to easily integrate WAF, API Gateway and Authorizers. Allowing us to run our lambda offline created a great experience as well.
>
> `Serverless Framework, API Gateway, WAF, Cloudfront`

>   Other projects worth mentioning: Contract testing (Pact-js) - PoC, A/B Tests with Lambda@Egde and Optimizely - PoC
